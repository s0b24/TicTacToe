# TicTacToe

Hello!  

While creating the game, I used some information from:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa5egLurW5U&list=PLcSIMAULmMyftO2SvNGE5mmYKKeAWCJUm&ab_channel=PracticalCoding

I used ChatGPT to solve some issues in the code and to add some elements I wasn't familiar with. However, all game logic and visualization were created by me.

The TicTacToe folder in the repository contains the main files I created while building the app. I couldn't upload all the files because it's too much.  
The ZIP file includes the entire project.
